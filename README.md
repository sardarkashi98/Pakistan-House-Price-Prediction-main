## Data Import
The initial step involves importing the necessary libraries and the dataset. The dataset includes various features that influence house prices in Pakistan.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
### Checking for Null Values
Ensuring there are no missing values in the dataset to maintain data integrity.

### Dropping Duplicate Values
Removing any duplicate records to avoid redundancy and ensure data quality.

### Feature Engineering
Transforming and creating new features, such as converting area from Marla to square feet.

### Categorizing Features
Label encoding categorical features like property type, location, city, and purpose for use in machine learning models.

### Scaling Numerical Features
Standardizing numerical features to bring them to a common scale, which is essential for many machine learning algorithms.

## Machine Learning Models
### Splitting Data
Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.

### Decision Tree Regressor
Implementing and training a Decision Tree model to predict house prices.

### Random Forest Regressor
Using a Random Forest model, which is an ensemble method to improve prediction accuracy.

### Gradient Boosting Regressor
Applying Gradient Boosting techniques to further enhance the predictive performance.

### XGB Regressor
Utilizing the XGBoost model, known for its efficiency and accuracy in regression tasks.

## Model Evaluation
Assessing the models based on metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score to determine their performance.

## Testing with Example
Demonstrating the model predictions with an example test case and comparing it with the actual house price.

## Conclusion
In the context of predicting house prices, a lower prediction accuracy might sometimes be preferable or more realistic when considering practical constraints and the inherent uncertainty in real-world data. Setting a price range instead of a precise price is often more practical.
